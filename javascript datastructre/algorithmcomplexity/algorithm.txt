alogorithm  is steps to do anything
timecomplexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution
space complexity is the amount of space required to solve the problem 
space complexity is the auxiliary space + input size

stack mein fixed hi rehte hain element 
stack is linear data structure 
it follows lifo order
push add new element pop remove an element from the stack  many more operation  is empty ,is peak 
********************************************************************************
Queue
it follows  fifo 
 it is linear data structure
 two type of Queue
 enqueue add new element at thr end of the queue
 dequeue remove  element
 ********************************************************************************
 binary search -> no of inputs/2; it is required to sort the condition it is compulsory
 if the search element is less than mid thn it goes to the left of the queue otherwise it goes to the right

****************************************************************
object advantage over array it provide  easy identifiaction of element
map -> it is pair of key and value pair but in we use any data type incase object we cant use any datatype it is only string...
set data structure->it remove duplicacy of the data
****************************************************************
LInked list -> address of the next list
head ,tail,node(value,next) -> address
****************************************************************
Tree data structure
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tree is hierarchical representation 
it is connected through edges
data form hota nodes ke form mein 
tree is a non-linear data structure (it is not in sequence )
search-node tree logic  first we have to check root is equal to null 
1 first node which i search  khi wo root toh nhi hain 
jo value apun search kar rhe hain khi root se badii toh nhi hain 
jo vlaue search kar he hain wo exist kar rhi hain ki nhi 
****************************************************************
dfs ->it search node to the depth of the node 
preorder top to bottom (top->left->right)
inorder
postorder yeh kya karta hain har ek tree ka pehle left wala uthyega fir uske baad right wala afte that root 
bfs work on top level by level
delete node ka logic
1 .kii hume esi node delete karni hogi jiske na toh left node na toh right node  jaise last node of the tree  
2 . koi bhi node jiske ya toh left ho right node hain 
3 koi ek esi jiski dono left ur right 

****************************************************************
graph is a non linear structure that
node it is connected through edges and their representation is pictorial
two types of graph
Directed graph is it provide direction for traversing the nodes
undirected graph is not provide direction
disconnected graph which is not connected by edges 
Bi directional graph A<-> B 
Self loop graph  A<-> B -<-> B
use of graph 
 Google map  instagram mutual friend wlaa option 
 Adjacency matrix -. jab hum matrix ke form mein node banate hain
 Adjacency list -. Adjacency list jb list ke form mein hota hain
